#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE
#. # For each permission there are three strings:
#. #
#. #   * the permission name, displayed in the Settings app
#. #   *-appRequest = displayed in a dialog box when an app requires a permission
#. #   *-webRequest = displayed in a dialog box when a web site requires a permission
#. #
#. # The two latter strings are identical in English but might require a more
#. # specific phrasing in your locale. Note that permission dialogs will display
#. # two buttons: “Allow” and “Deny”.
